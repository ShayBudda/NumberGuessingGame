Hey, I gotta be honest with youâ€”playing that dumb number guessing game is a complete waste of time. Seriously, it's just a pointless, mind-numbing activity that doesn't do anything for you. You're not learning anything, you're not challenging yourself, and let's be real, you're probably not even having fun. It's like watching paint dry, but worse. You could be doing so many other things that actually matter, like picking up a new skill, hanging out with real people, or even just doing something productive. Come on, you're better than this.
////1) Open App https://shaybudda.github.io/NumberGuessingGame/ 
////2) Guess a number between 1 and 100 in the alert box
////3) do it till you win, but please don't have fun. There are better things to do
